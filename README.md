### **1. Find Email Addresses (Option 1)**
- **What it does**: The tool generates possible email addresses based on the first name and optional last name you provide.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter a first name and optionally a last name.
  - The tool combines the name with common email domains (e.g., `gmail.com`, `yahoo.com`) and creates possible email addresses.
  - It uses various name formats (e.g., `firstname.lastname`, `firstname_lastname`, `firstname123`).
- **Example**:
  - Input: First name = `john`, Last name = `doe`
  - Output: `john.doe@gmail.com`, `john_doe@yahoo.com`, `john123@outlook.com`, etc.

### **2. Get IP Information (Option 2)**
- **What it does**: The tool retrieves detailed information about an IP address.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter an IP address (e.g., `46.167.63.139`).
  - The tool uses the `ip-api.com` API to fetch details like country, region, city, ISP, organization, latitude, longitude, timezone, and more.
- **Example**:
  - Input: IP = `46.167.63.139`
  - Output: Country = `Germany`, City = `Berlin`, ISP = `Deutsche Telekom`, etc.

---

### **3. Get Phone Number Information (Option 3)**
- **What it does**: The tool analyzes a phone number and provides information such as location, carrier, and timezone.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter a phone number (e.g., `+49123456789`).
  - The tool uses the `phonenumbers` library to parse and analyze the number.
- **Example**:
  - Input: Phone number = `+49123456789`
  - Output: Location = `Germany`, Carrier = `Deutsche Telekom`, Timezone = `Europe/Berlin`.

---

### **4. Port Scanning (Option 4)**
- **What it does**: The tool scans an IP address for open ports.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter an IP address.
  - The tool checks which ports in the range 1â€“1024 are open.
  - It uses multithreading to speed up the scanning process.
- **Example**:
  - Input: IP = `192.168.1.1`
  - Output: `Port 80 is open`, `Port 22 is open`, etc.

---

### **5. Username Checker (Option 5)**
- **What it does**: The tool checks if a specific username is available on various platforms.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter a username (e.g., `johndoe`).
  - The tool checks the availability on platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, etc.
  - It sends an HTTP request to the platform and checks the status code (200 = username taken, 404 = username available).
- **Example**:
  - Input: Username = `johndoe`
  - Output: `[X] GitHub: https://github.com/johndoe (Username taken)`, `[âœ“] Twitter: https://twitter.com/johndoe (Username available)`.

---

### **6. MAC Address Lookup (Option 6)**
- **What it does**: This feature is not yet implemented but could be used to identify the manufacturer of a MAC address.
- **How it works**:
  - It would use an API like `macvendors.com` to fetch the manufacturer details.

---

### **7. Reverse IP Lookup (Option 7)**
- **What it does**: The tool finds all domains associated with a specific IP address.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter an IP address.
  - The tool uses the `hackertarget.com` API to retrieve a list of domains hosted on that IP.
- **Example**:
  - Input: IP = `46.167.63.139`
  - Output: `example.com`, `example2.com`, etc.

---

### **8. WHOIS Lookup (Option 8)**
- **What it does**: The tool retrieves WHOIS information for a domain.
- **How it works**:
  - You enter a domain (e.g., `example.com`).
  - The tool uses the `whois` library to fetch details like registration date, expiration date, registrar, and contact information.
- **Example**:
  - Input: Domain = `example.com`
  - Output: Registration date = `2020-01-01`, Registrar = `GoDaddy`, etc.

---

### **Additional Features**
- **Banner and Menu**:
  - The tool displays a colorful banner and a menu listing all available options.
- **Error Handling**:
  - The tool catches errors and displays user-friendly messages if something goes wrong (e.g., invalid input or network errors).
- **Colorful Output**:
  - The output is color-coded for better readability (green = success, red = error, yellow = warning).

---
